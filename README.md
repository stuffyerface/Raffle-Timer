# Raffle-Timer
An extremely basic [chattriggers](https://www.chattriggers.com/) module for Hypixel Year 300 Event.

Depending on the version, it gives you a 20 minute timer for active/playtime warnings with a 30 second warning as well on some versions.

### Requires [ChatTriggers](https://www.chattriggers.com/)
To install, unzip the file and put it into the modules folder `/ct files` then put the folder into the modules folder. Then do `/ct load`

(That folder is also found in your `.minecraft/config/ChatTriggers/modules` folder.)

Versions are found under the releases tab.
